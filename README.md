# Mock Dashboard

Mock Dashboard is a comprehensive template built using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS, designed to serve as a foundational starting point for dashboard applications. It features a rich set of UI and container components that enable rapid development and customization of dashboard interfaces. With built-in authentication features, including login, logout, and signup, utilizing JWT tokens, this project lays the groundwork for secure and scalable applications. While persistent login functionality is on the roadmap, the current version focuses on providing a robust and responsive framework for building dashboard applications. The entire application is Dockerized for ease of development, testing, and deployment.

## Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React for UI, Vite for fast development and builds, and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Authentication**: Full login, logout, and signup flows with JWT tokens for secure access.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to improve the user experience and ease development.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Dockerized Application**: Simplifies setup, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed to be forked and serve as a baseline for future dashboard applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MockDashboard.git
cd MockDashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the application with Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will containerize your application and run it in a Docker environment. The application will be accessible on `http://localhost:3000` or another port specified in your Docker configuration.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, ensure Docker is set up for production environments, focusing on security, efficiency, and reliability.
